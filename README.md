# Immigration to Canada

## Introduction
The following Data Visualization was performed by **Alan Rial** (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-rial/), and was finalized on 10/30/2022. 

## Objective
As a new Canadian, I was curious to see which country most immigrants come from, what's the gender and age distribution of the new Canadians, and how the trends changed in the last 30 years. I used my curiosity as an opportunity to practice Data Visualization with Tableau & Data Wrangling with Excel.

## Tools
- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau 

## Steps
1) Data Sourcing
2) Data Wrangling
3) Dashboard Development

## The Data
The dataset used was found on the United Nations - Population Division website: https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/content/international-migrant-stock/

Additionally, Canadian Population Data was found on Worldometer: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/canada-population
